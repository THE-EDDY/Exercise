### **Brief**

1 - Answer these questions about the design of this [landing](https://logtail.com/)

a) What makes this a good design? What elements? What decisions?

b) How do you think was the process of the designers to get to this result?

2 - Using Figma, create a mood board about the landing. Represent these three aspects:

a) Color palette

b) Illustrations style (related in some way to the landing)

c) Typography (find one similar in Google fonts if the original is not free)

### **Important clarifications**

- These 2 points should take you less than an hour.
- The mood board should not be a big design project, it is just to demonstrate you have a well understanding of Figma as a tool. Think of it as a sketching task that should be done in around half an hour, it's shouldn't be pixel perfect.
